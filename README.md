# Trading
Unfortunately my professional code is under non-disclosure with my employer.  However, for this example I am including three key pieces of code that are part of a larger effort.  This code is not as extensively documented as would normally be done in a collaborative coding environment or for academic reproducability.  

## Sample Code

* fx3b.r - This is an historical simulation to determine if a currency trading strategy would be profitable.  The simulation collects key parameters and historical data and provides summary and detailed output data sets for review.  This is all written in R.  
* fx3.java - This an actual implmentation of the currency trading strategy.  This is coded in Java and integrate directly with a currency broker.  The code outputs key pieces of information during execution for historical and diagnostic purposes.
* fx3c.py - This is a rewrite of the implmeentation in Python.  For a variety of reasons a Python implementation for future work was more appropriate. 
This is a series of work representing coding for a currency trading(forex) opportunity.
